1. Python Libraries for Image Processing:
OpenCV: A powerful library for image processing.
PIL (Pillow): A library for opening, manipulating, and saving images.
NumPy: For numerical operations, which are essential for image manipulation.

    # pip install opencv-python pillow numpy


2. Basic Image Operations:

    #Reading and Displaying Images
    import cv2
    from PIL import Image
    
    # Reading an image using OpenCV
    image = cv2.imread('example.jpg')
    
    # Displaying the image using OpenCV
    cv2.imshow('Image', image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    
    # Reading and displaying an image using Pillow
    image_pil = Image.open('example.jpg')
    image_pil.show()

3. Mathematical Image Processing: 

Image Addition: Combining two images by adding their pixel values.
Image Subtraction: Highlighting differences by subtracting pixel values.
Image Multiplication: Scaling image intensities.
Image Blending: Combining images with weighted pixel values.

    import cv2
    
    # Read two images
    image1 = cv2.imread('image1.jpg')
    image2 = cv2.imread('image2.jpg')
    
    # Image Addition
    added_image = cv2.add(image1, image2)
    cv2.imshow('Added Image', added_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    
    # Image Subtraction
    subtracted_image = cv2.subtract(image1, image2)
    cv2.imshow('Subtracted Image', subtracted_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    
    # Image Blending (Weighted Addition)
    alpha = 0.5  # Weight for image1
    beta = 1.0 - alpha  # Weight for image2
    blended_image = cv2.addWeighted(image1, alpha, image2, beta, 0)
    cv2.imshow('Blended Image', blended_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
